# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Project
A simple Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Two players take turns placing X and O on a 3x3 board. The game checks for a winner after each move and declares a winner if three marks align horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If the board fills without a winner, it ends in a draw. Great for practicing Python and game logic.
